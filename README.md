Example of making using and testing an API in python

Inspired by the article https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/ this project is a learning excercise.

I am making use of the Restfull Booker application (https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) "An API playground created by Mark Winteringham for those wanting to learn more about API testing and tools".

I am also making use of the assert_that module (https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/assertpy)

You can run the test in pytest using:
pytest .\test_restfull_bookings.py
